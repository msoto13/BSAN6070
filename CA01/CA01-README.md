CA01: Exploratory Data Analysis – House Price Analysis

Copy the following path exactly and paste it in your pd.read_csv() line of the code.
https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/raw/main/CA01/house-price-train.csv

Part 1: Data Understanding – Output of this part will be various visualization of the
variable analysis and finally the Data Quality Report that will identify the data problems
that exist in this dataset.
Part 2: In this part you will fix the data problems identified in the Data Quality Report
learning from python techniques and code samples shared with you (links provided in
the slide deck).
Part 3: For this part, ONLY do the “collinearity” visualization and identification of the
features that needs to be dropped (feature selection), if any. You DO NOT NEED to do
the “class imbalance” step, as this has not been covered yet in class.
All work, descriptions, explanation, observation, conclusion etc. must be in the Notebook
itself. No separate report is needed. Your final deliverable is ONLY your notebook, which
you will upload @BrightSpace Submission folder for CA01.
