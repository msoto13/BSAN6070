Colab/Jupiter Notebook
I suggest opening the notebook in Google Colab.

Make sure to take advantage of the outline of the notebook to get the best reviewing experience. It is a long notebook broken into logical sections and subsections.

If you have any problems with running the code, please let me know, msoto13@lion.lmu.edu
