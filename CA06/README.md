Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project aims to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm to better understand the different types of customers in a given dataset. 

The dataset used for this project is the 'Mall_Customers.csv' dataset, which contains information about customers of a mall.

Dataset
The 'Mall_Customers.csv' dataset contains the following attributes:

  CustomerID: Unique ID for each customer
  
  Gender: Male or Female
  
  Age: Age of the customer
  
  Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
  
  Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature (higher scores indicate higher spending)
  
The dataset was downloaded from the following link:
https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/raw/main/CA06/Mall_Customers.csv

Runtime
<1 minute

The following steps were taken to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm:

1. Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Prepare the data for clustering by performing feature scaling and selecting the appropriate features for clustering
3. Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Silhouette Method
4. Train the K-Means model with the optimal number of clusters and obtain the cluster assignments for each data point
5. Visualize and analyze the clusters by creating a scatter plot of the selected features, colored by cluster assignment
6. Interpret the clusters and provide a brief description of each cluster
7. Provide recommendations based on the analysis


Conclusion
By performing customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm, we were able to gain valuable insights into the different types of customers and their spending behavior. 
Based on the cluster characteristics, we provided recommendations for the mall to tailor its marketing strategies to target specific customer segments. 
It is important for the mall to continuously monitor customer behavior and adjust its marketing strategies accordingly to remain competitive in the market.
