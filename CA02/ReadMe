CA02: Spam Email Detection using Naive Bayes Algorithm

Overview:
This exercise trains the model with set of emails labelled as either from Spam or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category. I test the model on 260 emails. Lastly, I ask the model to predict the category of this emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification.

Runtime:
It takes a few minutes to run the notebook, so please be patient!

Data:
Data folders should be located in the same folder with the Jupiter Notebook/Collab file. Do not rename the folder/file names!

Steps to Follow:
1. Create your own personal Google Colab file and download/import necessary files
2. Clean and prepare the data (removing stop words, removing less frequent words)
3. Create dictionary for the most common 3000 words
4. Create frequency and word label matrix
5. Choose the model to use, in our case, use the Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
6. Analyze your accuracy score

If you have any problems with running the code, please let me know, msoto13@lion.lmu.edu
